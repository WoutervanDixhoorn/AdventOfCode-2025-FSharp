# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025: F# Edition

Welcome to my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2025** challenges!

I have never managed to finish a complete year because life (and shiny distractions) always got in the way. But this year is different! I am trying again, and to make things interesting, I decided to learn a completely new language while I'm at it.

## Why F#?
At the office, we are always debating different technologies. Some particular colleagues of mine are die-hard fans of Functional Programming.

I am finally succumbing to their enthusiasm (and arguably, peer pressure). I'm giving F# a serious try, hopefully my brain won't buffer too hard on the syntax!

## How to run the solutions
These solutions are built to take input via the command line pipe.

### Running the code
1. Navigate to the specific day's directory (e.g., `cd Day01`).
2. Run the following command based on your OS:

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
Get-Content input.txt > dotnet fsi main.fsx
```

**Linux (Bash)**
```bash
cat input.txt | dotnet fsi main.fsx
```
